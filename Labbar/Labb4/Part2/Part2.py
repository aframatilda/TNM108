# ------------- A detour: try out CountVectorizer & TF-IDF -------------

# Turn off pretty printing of jupyter notebook... it generates long lines
# %pprint

# Three tiny "documents"
docs = ['A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.',
        'Oh, what a fine day it is.',
        "A day ain't over till it's truly over."]

# Initialize a CountVectorizer to use NLTK's tokenizer instead of its
#    default one (which ignores punctuation and stopwords).
# Minimum document frequency set to 1.
fooVzer = CountVectorizer(min_df=1, tokenizer=nltk.word_tokenize)

# .fit_transform does two things:
# (1) fit: adapts fooVzer to the supplied text data (rounds up top words into vector space)
# (2) transform: creates and returns a count-vectorized output of docs
docs_counts = fooVzer.fit_transform(docs)
# print(docs_counts)

# fooVzer now contains vocab dictionary which maps unique words to indexes
fooVzer.vocabulary_
# print(fooVzer.vocabulary_)

# docs_counts has a dimension of 3 (document count) by 16 (# of unique words)
docs_counts.shape
# print(docs_counts.shape)

# this vector is small enough to view in a full, non-sparse form!
docs_counts.toarray()

# Convert raw frequency counts into TF-IDF (Term Frequency -- Inverse Document Frequency) values
fooTfmer = TfidfTransformer()

# Again, fit and transform

# TF-IDF values
# raw counts have been normalized against document length,
# terms that are found across many docs are weighted down ('a' vs. 'rose')
docs_tfidf.toarray()
# print(docs_tfidf.toarray())


# --------- Back to real data: movie reviews ----------

# initialize CountVectorizer
# use top 3000 words only. 78.25% acc.
movieVzer = CountVectorizer(
    min_df=2, tokenizer=nltk.word_tokenize, max_features=3000)
# movieVzer = CountVectorizer(min_df=2, tokenizer=nltk.word_tokenize)         # use all 25K words. Higher accuracy

# fit and tranform using training text
docs_train_counts = movieVzer.fit_transform(docs_train)
# 'screen' is found in the corpus, mapped to index 2290
t = movieVzer.vocabulary_.get('screen')
# print(t)

# Likewise, Mr. Steven Seagal is present...
mv = movieVzer.vocabulary_.get('seagal')
# print(mv)

# Convert raw frequency counts into TF-IDF values
movieTfmer = TfidfTransformer()
docs_train_tfidf = movieTfmer.fit_transform(docs_train_counts)

# huge dimensions! 1,600 documents, 3K unique terms.
d = docs_train_counts.shape
# print(d)

# Using the fitted vectorizer and transformer, tranform the test data
docs_test_counts = movieVzer.transform(docs_test)
docs_test_tfidf = movieTfmer.transform(docs_test_counts)


# ----------- Training and testing a Naive Bayes classifier ---------

# Now ready to build a classifier.
# We will use Multinominal Naive Bayes as our model
# Train a Multimoda Naive Bayes classifier. Again, we call it "fitting"
clf = MultinomialNB()

y_pred = clf.predict(docs_test_tfidf)

# Making the Confusion Matrix

# ------------ Trying the classifier on fake movie reviews -----------

# very short and fake movie reviews
